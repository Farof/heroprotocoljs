replay.tracker.events is an array containing events whose types are specified in the `protocol#####.js` files under the `tracker_event_types` variable.

---

Convert `m_unitTagIndex` and `m_unitTagRecycle` into a unit tag `m_tag` with `protocol.unitTag(m_unitTagIndex, m_unitTagRecycle)`.

`m_tag` is useful to determine what unit was targeted by a skill, for example in this `NNet.Game.SCmdEvent` present in the `replay.game.events` file:

```
{
    "_eventid": 27,
    "m_unitGroup": null,
    "_event": "NNet.Game.SCmdEvent",
    "m_abil": {
        "m_abilLink": 147,
        "m_abilCmdIndex": 0,
        "m_abilCmdData": null
    },
    "_gameloop": 2365,
    "_bits": 264,
    "m_data": {
        "TargetUnit": {
            "m_snapshotControlPlayerId": 6,
            "m_snapshotPoint": {
                "y": 235853,
                "x": 579289,
                "z": 32441
            },
            "m_snapshotUpkeepPlayerId": 6,
            "m_timer": 0,
            "m_targetUnitFlags": 111,
            "m_snapshotUnitLink": 281,
            "m_tag": 45350913
        }
    },
    "_userid": {
        "m_userId": 5
    },
    "m_cmdFlags": 2097408,
    "m_sequence": 451,
    "m_otherUnit": null
}
```

We see that the unit with tag `45350913` was the target of the ability id `147` casted by player `5`.

Convert `m_tag` into a unit tag index `m_unitTagIndex` and unit tag recycle `m_unitTagRecycle` with `protocol.unitTagIndex(m_tag)` and `protocol.unitTagRecycle(m_tag)`.

There is a known issue where revived units are not tracked, and placeholder units track death but not birth.

The first 10 events are `NNet.Replay.Tracker.SPlayerSetupEvent` events, one for each player. Should check if there are also 10 if playing with or versus A.I.

Should map values to known in-game elements. Check each value count to narrow down what they could be.

Does the L2 and L3 suffix reffer to each team? Each color? Orientation?

Create tool to extract values programmatically instead of by hand.

    "_gameloop": 16102,
    "_bits": 176,
    "m_upkeepPlayerId": 11
}
```

Here `m_upkeepPlayerId`/`m_controlPlayerId` is 11, meaning the control of the statue was granted to the blue team.

## 5. m_controlPlayerId (number)

## 5. m_count (number)

## 6. m_playerId (number)

References one of the 16 game slot, need to find which.

Probably not always referencing a player because a possible value is `15`?

- GatesAreOpen
- IsPlayer11
- IsPlayer12
- MinionsAreSpawning
- VehicleDragonUpgrade

# NNet.Replay.Tracker.SUnitInitEvent

Not encountered in data dump. Structure extracted from source code.

`NNet.Replay.Tracker.SUnitInitEvent` events appear for units under construction. When complete you'll see a `NNet.Replay.Tracker.SUnitDoneEvent` with the same unit tag.

You may receive a `NNet.Replay.Tracker.SUnitDiedEvent` after either a UnitInit or UnitBorn event for the corresponding unit tag.

## 5. m_controlPlayerId (number)

## 6. m_unitTagIndex (number)

## 7. m_unitTagRecycle (number)

## 8. m_unitTypeName (string)

## 5. m_unitTagIndex (number)

## 6. m_unitTagRecycle (number)

# NNet.Replay.Tracker.SUnitPositionsEvent

- Interpret the NNet.Replay.Tracker.SUnitPositionsEvent events like this:

        var unitIndex = event.m_firstUnitIndex;
        for (var i = 0, ln = event.m_items.length; i < ln; i += 3) {
          unitIndex += event.m_items[i + 0];
          var x = event.m_items[i + 1] * 4;
          var y = event.m_items[i + 2] * 4;
          // unit identified by unitIndex at the current event._gameloop time is at approximate position (x, y)
        }

- Only units that have inflicted or taken damage are mentioned in unit position events, and they occur periodically with a limit of 256 units mentioned per event.

## 5. m_firstUnitIndex (number)

- 1 = real player?

## 8. m_userId (number)

Index for the player, ranges from 0 to 9.

Identical to `m_slotId`.
